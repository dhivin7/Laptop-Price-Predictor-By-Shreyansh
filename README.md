# Laptop-Price-Predictor-By-Shreyansh
This project entails the development of a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on various features. 
The workflow includes:
1. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance model performance.
4. Modeling: Building and training machine learning models to predict laptop prices.
5. Website Deployment: Deploying the model onto a website to make predictions accessible to users.
    This project serves as a comprehensive example of the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
